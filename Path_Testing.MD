Path: Given a graph G, a path p is a sequence of vertices V_1,..., V_n in G, such that: for all i in [1; n-1], (V_i, V_i+1) is an edge

Test Coverage Metrics: 

  1) Node - all nodes in the control flow graph are visited when tests are executed
  2) Edge - all edges in the control flow graph are visited when tests are executed
  3) Condition - all conditional predicaments are evaluated to both true and false
  4) Path - all paths in the control flow graph are visited when tests are executed
